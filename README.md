The ATmega32u4 breakout board makes it easy to get up and going with an AVR Microcontroller with plenty of IO features such as SPI, TWI, and UART as well as a Full-Speed USB interface. Standard pitch spacing on the headers allow it to be inserted into a breadboard and used for prototyping or through-hole soldered down onto a larger project/carrier board.

The getting started guide, hardware documentation and example firwmare for this board is available at [os.everydaydev.io](https://os.everydaydev.io/docs/atmega32u4_breakout). If you'd like to build one yourself, the latest Gerber files and schematics can be found in the [Release](https://github.com/everyday-dev/atmega32u4_breakout/releases) section on Github.
